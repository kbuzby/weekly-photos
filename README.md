=============

This small script takes photos from my company's dropbox on my local machine and according to file Inspectors.xlsx it takes the files in set project folders, and moves them to our local network photo storage server into folders organized by date.

On Friday's I have to compile a photo report for my boss, the script checks if it is Friday, and will get the most recent photos for the last week in each job in Inspector's.xlsx and will take a random amount from each job folder and copy them to a weekly report folder.
